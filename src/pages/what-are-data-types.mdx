# What are "Data Types"?

In a previous chapter we explored _values_, and decided they are just the "things" that we can access inside of our programs. But when we say "things", we really mean something like "pieces of data".

> In programming, _values_ are just the pieces of data we can access inside of our program.

"Data" is at the heart of programming, and in programming we generally have multiple different _types_ of data (such as numbers or lists). So a _data type_ is really just a type of data :shrug:. In the upcoming chapters we'll be looking at a few different data types and what we can do with them!
