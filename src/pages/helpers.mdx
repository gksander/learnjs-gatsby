# Helpers

[In the previous chapter](/what-is-javascript#-helpers) we saw some helpers that aren't naturally part of JavaScript per se, but we (the authors) added in by us so we can do cool stuff while learning about programming! These helpers all start with a `$`. In this chapter, we'll just skim some of these helpers so you know what's available to you.

> Don't expect to understand the code in this chapter. In fact, feel free to skip this chapter initially, or just skim the live snippets to see what kind of stuff we can eventually do.

## The $log helper

We can "log" values to the screen using the `$log` helper. This just prints some text into a "logging" area. Here's an example.

```js live=true
$log("Hello world!");
$log(15 * 35);
```
